# Gin-Mongo Learning Project

This little project only serves personal and educational purposes. It builds a little backend server, using the Go language and a neat, but very powerful web framework called [Gin Gonic](https://gin-gonic.com/). 

Maybe this is exactly what you need when you need a backend for frontend projects written in React, Vue or Svelte -- like me. As a database I'm using a local MongoDB installation, so if you want to try it yourself, you need access to a MongoDB installation, either on your own system or on 
[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).

As mentioned before, this project is educational, too. If you want to follow along the steps I took to build it, just follow the `master` branch history of this project. That should provide you with all the information you need.

Have fun!
